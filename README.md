This repository contains code and datasets, which use simple models to predict diabetes based on Patient's Health.
The code in this repository will follow the steps below:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. Preprocessing.
3. Visualization.
4. Building Pipeline.
5. Evaluate metrics.
After completion, the complete pipeline can handle raw data and transform it into a useful value for the user.
